            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Omowunmi, I am an International student from Nigeria and I am in the United States to earn an Undergraduate degree.
                I grew up amongst 2 brothers and a younger sister with my mother and father. We lived in the Nigerian state of Lagos.
                I attended high-school in Nigeria and graduated 2021 with my earned diploma.

                <h2 class="about-me-sub-header">Educational Background</h2>
                I am a Computer science major at the University of Illinois, Springfield(UIS) and I'm set to graduate the fall of 26. 
                I am also a transfer student at UIS. I transferred from a community college in Oakland, California called Laney college.
                I got an associates in Mathematics from Laney college and I came to Springfield as I had family and friends here.

                <h2 class="about-me-sub-header">My interests</h2>
                I am a passionate and curious person with a wide range of interests. I love music and singing, and I often find joy in expressing myself through cooking and baking. 
                I’ve always enjoyed solving math problems, and that love for problem-solving has grown into a fascination with learning new, hands-on skills—especially those with real-world application, like coding, web design, nail care, and makeup techniques.
                I also have a soft spot for sunsets; there’s something peaceful about capturing their beauty through photography. I’m always on the lookout for new hobbies to explore. Lately, I’ve been drawn to learning how to play the guitar and studying color theory.So I enrolled
                for an intro to Guitar course and have mastered enough to play basic songs in front of a crowd. My faith plays a big role in my life. 
                I love going to church and spending time in prayer—it brings me deep peace and clarity. I also enjoy reading the Bible. To me, it’s not just a book but a collection of real stories from real people, and I find it meaningful to learn from their experiences and mistakes.

                <h2 class="about-me-sub-header">Career Prospects</h2>
                Initially, my academic path focused on law, and I remain committed to the discipline and analytical thinking it requires. 
                However, my deep dive into computer science and mathematics has revealed a powerful passion for Data Science.
                The web constantly generates vast amounts of data, creating an urgent and growing need for professionals who can effectively manage, 
                analyze, and store this information. This is where I want to focus my career. I am drawn to the blend of mathematical analysis and technical implementation that defines the field.
                I have decided to dedicate my energy to mastering these skills through a Master's program in Data Science, 
                a path that allows me to satiate my desire to learn more about advanced data analytics and web technologies.

                <p>
                    During my first semester at Laney College, I took an introductory computer science course where we were expected to explore the Raspberry Pi's operating environment — with very little instruction from the professor.
                    As a newcomer to both the school and the system, I was shocked to learn that our midterm and final projects depended entirely on our ability to build something functional using the Raspberry Pi — independently. I had to figure out everything from assembling the device to writing the software that would run on it.
                    To get started, I turned to YouTube tutorials and joined a Discord group created by other students in the class to share resources and advice — both of which proved incredibly helpful. On top of that, I had to teach myself the Python programming language from scratch, all within about three months.
                    After many sleepless nights and countless videos, I was able to create a game using Python in the Raspberry Pi environment. It was one of the most challenging semesters I’ve experienced, and one I’ll never forget.
                    This Raspberry Pi project demonstrated my ability to apply Python to real-world hardware challenges. While the physical device and source code were unfortunately lost during a recent move, 
                    I have documented the build process and key code components with images. This experience taught me a crucial lesson about redundant data backup strategies, which I am now applying to all my current development work."

            <h2 class="project-sub-header">Working with jupyter notebooks </h2>
                <p>  
                    In Summer 2023, I took a 5-unit class called CIS 61: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. Out of all my college courses so far, this class had the most profound impact on my technical understanding of computer programming.
                    What stood out wasn’t just the content, but also the instructor’s engaging and unconventional teaching style. She had a fun habit of starting each class by encouraging students to explore anime and manga, which created a light, interactive atmosphere that many students — myself included — enjoyed.
                    Beyond the fun, the class deeply explored the foundational concepts of programming. We discussed the similarities across different programming paradigms, including functional, structured, and object-oriented programming.
                    We also covered key programming language principles and data structures, focusing especially on how these structures operate in Python using Jupyter Notebooks and pre-configured GitHub repositories.
                    Through this class, I learnt how to use jupyter notebooks and it prepared me to go into coding in C, C++ and Java.
                    This project allowed me to master the use of Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization. I gained foundational skills in processing data sets and creating reproducible reports. This work was a key factor in choosing my intended Master's program.

                <p> 
                    I chose to take Physics with Calculus as a personal challenge. It was not a requirement for my major or minor, 
                    but I was motivated to step outside my comfort zone and engage with a subject I had never formally studied
                    This Physics with Calculus class was one of the most intellectually demanding challenges I have undertaken. 
                    While the subject matter was difficult and stretched my problem-solving limits in a completely new domain, 
                    I learned great lessons in resilience, the importance of seeking help from peers and mentors, and 
                    effective time management under extreme pressure. This course proved to me that I can face and learn from complex, 
                    unfamiliar challenges, a skill that is essential in web development.

                <h2 class="project-sub-header">Mastering Data Structures Across Languages (C++ to Java)</h2>
                <p>
                    After transferring from my 2-year college, I faced a significant technical challenge.
                    My new university's computer science curriculum was taught exclusively in Java, while my foundational coursework—including Data Structures—had been completed in C and C++.
                    This required me to learn Java from scratch and immediately apply it to complex topics. 
                    I essentially had to re-learn Data Structures, implementing concepts like Linked Lists, Trees, 
                    and Hash Maps in an entirely new object-oriented environment.
                    While the syntax and memory models were very different, the core concepts were the same. 
                    This process was invaluable. It forced me to separate the fundamental theory of data structures
                    from the implementation of one language. I successfully made the transition, deepened my understanding 
                    of both C++ and Java, and proved to myself that I can quickly adapt and master new technologies. It was in this process that I learned to 
                    use github in saving and sharing files across a workspace.
