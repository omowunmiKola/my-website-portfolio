            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Omowunmi, I am an International student from Nigeria and I am in the United States to earn an Undergraduate degree.
                I grew up amongst 2 brothers and a younger sister with my mother and father. We lived in the Nigerian state of Lagos.
                I attended high-school in Nigeria and graduated 2021 with my earned diploma.

                <h2 class="about-me-sub-header">Educational Background</h2>
                I am a Computer science major at the University of Illinois, Springfield(UIS) and I'm set to graduate the fall of 26. 
                I am also a transfer student at UIS. I transferred from a community college in Oakland, California called Laney college.
                I got an associates in Mathematics from Laney college and was going to transfer to one of the University of California but I was not accepted in any so I came to UIS as I had family and friends here.

                <h2 class="about-me-sub-header">My interests</h2>
                I am a passionate and curious person with a wide range of interests. I love music and singing, and I often find joy in expressing myself through cooking and baking. 
                I’ve always enjoyed solving math problems, and that love for problem-solving has grown into a fascination with learning new, hands-on skills—especially those with real-world application, like coding, web design, nail care, and makeup techniques.
                I also have a soft spot for sunsets; there’s something peaceful about capturing their beauty through photography. I’m always on the lookout for new hobbies to explore. Lately, I’ve been drawn to learning how to play the guitar and studying color theory.
                My faith plays a big role in my life. I love going to church and spending time in prayer—it brings me deep peace and clarity. I also enjoy reading the Bible. To me, it’s not just a book but a collection of real stories from real people, and I find it meaningful to learn from their experiences and mistakes.

                <h2 class="about-me-sub-header">Career Prospects</h2>
                I am planning to go into law after getting my Bachelor's degree, In fact, I am currently preparing, alongside my undergraduate program, for my LSAT's.
                But because of the delay in my graduation, I might have to take the LSAT's next year. Another career i'm interested in is Data Science and Mathematics.
                Because the world deals in lots of data easily available through the web, there is a growing need for people that can manage, store and analyse this data effectively.
                Also i'm drawn to the name as it sounds cool.

                    During my first semester at Laney College, I took an introductory computer science course where we were expected to explore the Raspberry Pi's operating environment — with very little instruction from the professor.
                    As a newcomer to both the school and the system, I was shocked to learn that our midterm and final projects depended entirely on our ability to build something functional using the Raspberry Pi — independently. I had to figure out everything from assembling the device to writing the software that would run on it.
                    To get started, I turned to YouTube tutorials and joined a Discord group created by other students in the class to share resources and advice — both of which proved incredibly helpful. On top of that, I had to teach myself the Python programming language from scratch, all within about three months.
                    After many sleepless nights and countless videos, I was able to create a game using Python in the Raspberry Pi environment. It was one of the most challenging semesters I’ve experienced, and one I’ll never forget.

            <h2 class="project-sub-header">Working with jupyter notebooks </h2>
                <p>  
                    In Summer 2023, I took a 5-unit class called CIS 61: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. Out of all my college courses so far, this class had the most profound impact on my technical understanding of computer programming.
                    What stood out wasn’t just the content, but also the instructor’s engaging and unconventional teaching style. She had a fun habit of starting each class by encouraging students to explore anime and manga, which created a light, interactive atmosphere that many students — myself included — enjoyed.
                    Beyond the fun, the class deeply explored the foundational concepts of programming. We discussed the similarities across different programming paradigms, including functional, structured, and object-oriented programming.
                    We also covered key programming language principles and data structures, focusing especially on how these structures operate in Python using Jupyter Notebooks and pre-configured GitHub repositories.
                    Through this class, I learnt how to use jupyter notebooks and it prepared me to go into coding in C, C++ and Java.

            <h2 class="project-sub-header">Physics with calculus labs</h2>
                <p> 
                    To fulfill my international student requirement of enrolling in at least one in-person class per semester with a minimum number of units, I chose to take a physics course — even though it had nothing to do with my degree.
                    Looking back, this was one of the biggest academic mistakes I’ve made. The class pushed my limits in ways I wasn’t prepared for. It tested my ability to calculate, problem-solve, and — quite honestly — brought me to tears because I didn’t understand what I was doing most of the time.
                    Despite giving it my best effort, I didn’t pass the course. Maybe one day, far in the future, I’ll return to physics with a fresh perspective and a bit more confidence.
